## Introduction
Malaria affects over 200 million people every year, all over the world. Although there are cases on virtually every continent, 92% of the disease burden lies in sub-saharan Africa. Last year alone over 405,000 people died from malaria. 

To eliminate the disease fully, practices need to be in place that can address the issue before it has spread to new regions and to efficiently distribute limited resources to the areas in need. That is why I propose a machine learning model that predicts the disease dynamics and potential new hotspots for the disease so that timely aid may be distributed and stop the spread of the disease. 

A challenge that comes with the disease is the number of asymptomatic individuals who spread the disease to uninfected areas. In highly affected regions, like Nigeria, almost everyone has parasites, but without symptoms. As transportation systems improve and human interconnectedness increases, understanding human mobility becomes essential for disease prevention. Malaria is also difficult to track because of the seasonality of the disease. To fully understand the spread of the disease it is essential to understand both mosquito and human population dynamics.

A common model to predict malaria incidence is the ARIMA model because it is able to account for the transmissibility and seasonality of malaria and it has more predictive power than other machine learning models. The main limitation of the ARIMA structure is that it relies on the assumption that there is a linear correlation in the data. The newer LSTM model has had success predicting events over long time periods and with lags in time series because of its ability to maintain contextual information. The performance of the ARIMA can be improved using an LSTM when they are combined using a stacked architecture structure. 

## Inquiry
My research asks what is the best way to predict malaria disease dynamics using machine learning? The machine learning models that are used to predict how the disease will spread are a vital part of the research, but before that comes finding the best data sources. Looking at the different data sources is explanatory because it is looking at the factors which contribute to the disease. A big part of determining the data is figuring out which data types contribute the most to the spread of the disease. The first sub-question of my research asks, what is the best combination of covariates that most closely relate to the spread of the disease? Machine learning models are only as good as the data they are given, and they improve over time with more accurate data. Through the different research papers, each author uses a different combination of covariates from weather, rainfall, humidity, temperature, elevation, topographic wetness, vegetation, land cover, distance to water, infrastructure, travel, socioeconomic, population, CDR, and human movement data to train and test their models. That is why it is important to determine which subset of covariates will lead to the most accurate model, without overfitting. 

The second part of my research looks at the actual data science models and attempts to compare the pros and cons of each of the machine learning models to determine which model is best suited for predicting future disease dynamics. This part of the research is evaluative because it is looking at the effectiveness of the LSTM, ARIMA, and potentially the LSTM + ARIMA Stacked model. When trying to determine the best way to predict malaria disease dynamics, the second sub-question is asked. What is the best machine learning model to predict future cases and hotspots for malaria? 

Finally, the third sub-question is an attempt to eliminate a gap within the research. Oftentimes authors either focused on finding the right data types, or finding the right model, but never considered both. Different combinations of data will lead to varying performance outcomes with different models. That is why I try to look at the question of how do we find the best combinations of covariate data and which model would be best to pair it with? 

## Data 
The study done by the KCDC used data from 576 days between January 1st of 2016 to July 29th of 2017. For the infectious disease data they used information about malaria, scarlet fever, and chickenpox because the data was being reported frequently which was necessary for predicting future cases. Query data was also acquired from Twitter using a web crawler.
