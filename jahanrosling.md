## Response to Jahan and Rosling 

In the podcast, What is Human Development, Jahan defines what human development is as well as how to maximize human potential. The idea of what human development has shifted in recent years to focus less on solely economic growth, and more on human-based metrics. Jahan alludes to Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address when he states that human development must be “of the people, for the people, and by the people.” He defines human development as the process of enlarging human choices in every aspect of life including economic, cultural, and political choices. He states that an increase in human capabilities must be matched by an increase in opportunities to use such capabilities or else there will be a loss of human potential.

Jehan touches the HDI and what it means, as well as its perception. He refers to the HDI as the “crown jewel,” but this approach has led to a preoccupation with the HDI, using it as the only metric of how developed countries are. The HDI focuses on three main measures: long life, knowledge, and standard of living. While the HDI provides a useful measurement, it is only a focus measure, not a breadth measure. If the HDI is accepted as the breadth measure, true human development cannot be fully monitored, and it will stall. Jahan uses a metaphor to describe the relationship between breath and focus measures. He states that the breadth measure is the house, and the door is the focus measure. We cannot mistake the door to be the house, and when we reach the door, we must be sure to enter the house. 

Rosling starts his talk with data from a questionnaire he gave to his students. This questionnaire revealed that the issue with his students’ knowledge was not about ignorance, but about their preconceived notions about third world countries and the idea of “us versus them.” Rosling presented models of countries' development over time starting in the 1960s. These models presented two major conclusions: first, a strong healthcare system is a precursor to a booming economy, and second, regions and even countries should not be generalized to draw the same conclusions as there is a lot of variations within them. Rosling showed the major growth within Asia overtime which was especially prevalent in China, one of the biggest economies in the world. Rosling showed that after China took the time to drastically improve their healthcare system, the economic growth quickly followed, and continued to modern day. The second major conclusion stated that human development strategies must be customized within the context of individual sub-divisions of countries, because whole regions are vastly different. Often times we consider Africa to be the epitome of a third world region, and we treat the continent as one uniform region, but there is a wide range socioeconomic diversity within the continent, and therefore development goals must be addressed in an appropriate fashion.
