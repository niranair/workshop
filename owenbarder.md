## Question #2

### South Korea + Ghana: Why do some countries transform economically, and why don't others? What does this say about the economic models used to describe them?

Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana between 1960 and 2010 which showed that although they started at the same place, economically, South Korea has growth rapidly, and Ghana has failed to follow. The economic upheaval of South Korea has drastically changed the lives of the people.  This begs the question of why did the transformation occur in South Korea but not in Ghana. 

At first they started by looking at different economic models starting with the Harrod-Domar model which in basic terms started that an increase in capital and labor should lead to an increase in output. But, in reality, this proved to not be universal. Next, looking at the book, the Stages of Economic Growth, Rostow believed that an increase in investment in third world countries should trigger the economic cycle which should promote economic growth, but again, this proved to not be the case. That was when the neoclassical growth model was introduced, which seemed to fit the patterns of growth in both South Korea and Ghana. This model introduced the magic ingredient, ‘technical change’. But the fact is, the technical change didn’t really mean anything, it just accounted for the difference between the harrod-domar model without actually explaining the missing element. 

These failing economic models encouraged people to look at other sources of failure. At first they believed the issue lied with policy, but the washington consensus failure, which attributed lack of market growth and output to bad policy, inspired the current idea: that the issue lies not with policies but institutions. The nigeria steel example showed that although the country had ample resources and labor they were impaired by the significant corruption within their industry and country. 

## Question #11

### Creative Destruction + Co-Evolution: What is it and how does it relate to firms and industries? What is the significance of co-evolution?

The idea of creative destruction is defined by the "process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.”

This is preceded by examples of products that we take for granted and their evolutions overtime to become more efficient. It takes the idea of survival of the fittest and evolution from biology and applies it to firms and industries today. 

There is a difference between the process of adaptation between firms and industries which is illustrated by the Nokia example. Nokia went through one successful transformation when moving from rubber production to telecommunications, but in recent years has failed to adapt to the changing markets which are currently dominated by smart phones and smart technology. Although individual firms may fail to adapt, but by the creative destruction model, industries will continuously adapt as new firms replace old ones that have failed to transform. 

Co-evolution is the idea that people, products, firms, technologies, and institutions all interact with each other as they evolve and that every complex system we see is a result of adaptation or evolution of its components.
